" A Project not DOCUMENTED is a project not DONE " well Said by our mentor - Surya Penmetsa(2015 NITW alumni- ECE)  Initiative aims to develop documenting culture in and around the premises. It will make you feel the importance of keeping track of what you do in your engineering life to go for various interns and showcases! Make it a learning dias for the makers in the similar domain and at the same time the idea box for the great tinkerers around! Come forward and be a part of the good cause! Always remember, no project is too big and too small!  Mail your project docs (videos,instructables,ppts,abstracts etc) to theintegrateddesigners@gmail.com (prefer google drive)  ALL THE BEST Tinkerers!
